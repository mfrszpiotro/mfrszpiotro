- 👋 Hi, I’m @mfrszpiotro or Marcel if you prefer.
- 👀 I’m interested in movies and film-editing, but recently also in programming.
- 🌱 I know C and C++ from my studies and a commercial use of C# and Flask web framework (along with basics of Python, Bootstrap, Jinja2).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything! I am willing to learn literally anything :)
