- 👋 Hi, I’m @mfrszpiotro, or Marcel, if you prefer.
- 👀 I’m interested in movies and film-editing, but recently also in programming. I know C and C++ languages, but in short period I want to start learning C# or .NET (or maybe JS?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning object-oriented programming methods and basics of web-development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything! I am willing to learn literally anything :)
- 📫 How to reach me - e.g. by my steam profile: https://steamcommunity.com/id/fresz5543/...
- 📫 ... or by mail: marcel.piotrowski5543@gmail.com
