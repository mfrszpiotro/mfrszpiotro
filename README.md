- 👋 Hi, my name is Marcel!
- 👀 I’m interested in movies and film editing, but recently also in programming.
- 🐍 I like working with Python environments on daily basis (please judge me).
- 🌱 Always backend-focused, but recently I try my best to try frontend if its any fun.
- 🌮 Historically I also worked before with C, C++, C# and .NET Framework, it was fine I guess.
